# ShoppyGlobe - E-commerce Application
ShoppyGlobe is a React-based e-commerce platform designed with a clean UI, responsive layout, and a dynamic shopping cart. The application uses Redux for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and FontAwesome for icons. This README outlines the key components of the project, their functionalities, and how they interact.

## Components Overview

### 1. Header Component (Header.js)
The Header component renders the top navigation bar for the app. It features responsive design elements that adapt based on the screen size (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- Features:
    - Responsive Design:
       - For desktop, navigation links (Home, Cart, About) are displayed in a horizontal layout.
       - For mobile, a hamburger menu is used, which toggles the visibility of the links.
       - Cart Icon: Displays the number of items in the cart fetched from the Redux store.
      - Dropdown Navigation: Includes a dropdown menu for additional navigation, allowing users to programmatically navigate to the "About" page.
    - State Management:

      - isMenuOpen: Controls the visibility of the mobile menu.
      - selector: Fetches cart items from the Redux store using useSelector.
### 2. Error Component (Error.js)
The Error component handles errors that occur when a user navigates to an invalid or non-existent route. It provides a simple message and a button to redirect back to the homepage.
- Features:

    - Error Handling: Uses the useRouteError hook from react-router-dom to display the error details.
    - Home Button: A button is provided to redirect users back to the homepage (/productlist).

 ### 3. Custom Hook (UseFetch.js)
The UseFetch hook is a custom reusable hook for fetching data from an external API. It returns the data, loading, and error states to be used in components.

- Features:

    - Async Data Fetching: Fetches data from the provided URL using fetch.
    - Loading and Error States: Manages and exposes loading and error states for better user feedback.
 
### 4. Cart Component (Cart.js)
The Cart component displays the list of items added to the cart. It fetches cart items from the Redux store and allows users to clear the cart or modify items.

- Features:

    - Rendering Cart Items: Fetches and displays cart items stored in the Redux store.
    - Clear Cart: A button allows users to clear the cart by dispatching the clearCart action.
- State Management:

    - select: Retrieves cart items from the Redux store.
    - dispatch: Dispatches actions like clearCart.

 ### 5. CartItem Component (CartItem.js)
The CartItem component is used inside the Cart component to display individual items in the cart. It provides controls to adjust the quantity of the items or remove them from the cart.

- Features:
    - Quantity Control:
        - Increment/Decrement Buttons: These buttons allow users to adjust the quantity of the item in their cart. The updated quantity is then dispatched to the Redux store.
        - Total Price Calculation: Uses useEffect to recalculate the total price whenever the quantity or price changes.
        - Remove Item: A button that dispatches the removeItem action to remove the item from the cart.
 
### 6. Product List Component (ProductList.js)
The ProductList component fetches and displays a list of products from an external API using the UseFetch hook. It allows users to view product details and add items to their cart.

- Features:

    - Fetch Product Data: Fetches product data from an API using UseFetch.
    - Add to Cart: Users can add products to their cart by dispatching an action to the Redux store.

 ### 8.  Product Detail Page (ProductDetail.js)
The ProductDetail.js component is responsible for displaying detailed information about a specific product. It fetches data from an API using a custom UseFetch hook and integrates with the cart by allowing users to add the product directly to their cart.

- Key Features:
    - Dynamic Data Fetching: Fetches product data based on the product id passed via URL parameters.
    - Add to Cart: Allows users to add the product to their cart with a customizable quantity. Dispatches the addItem action from the CartSlice to update the cart.
